            <h2>our Roots</h2>

            <p>
                viewFinder, opened their original namesake shop with one employee, in Tel aviv, in 1995. They sold
                film,cameras, and processing materials. What started out as a small storefront and black and white ads
                in photography magazines, grew into our larger store at 17th Street which attracted a loyal customer
                base of photo, video, and audio professionals.In the early days of mail-order, when few could be
                trusted,
                viewFinder developed a reputation for honesty and genuine products, and the business grew by word of
                mouth. viewFinder's business continued to grow into the diverse and engaging company we are today,
                serving customers worldwide on our popular and highly rated website.
