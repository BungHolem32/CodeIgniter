This ultra-rugged camera’s super-bright f2.0 lens delivers superb image quality in the harshest conditions. Features like WiFi (remote camera operation, easy file sharing), time-interval shooting (similar to popular action cams), time-lapse movie (sunsets! starscapes!) and advanced GPS make the TG-3 Olympus’s most versatile outdoor camera ever.\r\n\r\n<h4>Built For The Long Haul</h4>\r\n\r\nDo friends sometimes doubt your stories about extreme adventures? They’ll believe you when they see the incredible images and videos you bring back with your TG-3 (or that you share instantly with built-in Wifi!). Its lifeproof construction takes whatever you can dish out – submersible to 15m/50 feet; functional in conditions as cold as -10°C/14°F; impact-resistant to 2.1m/7 feet; and crushproof to 100kgf/220 pounds of pressure.\r\n\r\n<h4>Accessorize Your TG-3</h4>\r\n\r\nThe TG-3 is unique among outdoor cameras for its many accessories. Waterproof lens options include a fisheye converter that captures gorgeous wide-angle shots – even underwater – and a tele converter that increases zoom capability from 4x to nearly 7x. Also available are a new LED Light Guide for macro photography and colorful float straps, an underwater housing and sturdy cases.\r\n\r\n', '<h4>The Fast And The Curious</h4>\nQuick start-up and fast autofocus – courtesy of Olympus iHS and FAST AF technology – ensure you’re always ready to shoot. The TG-3 dials up the shutter speed for blur-free action images, thanks to its ultra-bright high-speed f2.0 lens. You can also reduce the ISO to shoot crisp, detailed images with minimal noise in low light, or use the Aperture priority mode to expand the focus range of the background.\n\n<h4>Connect with your smart devices</h4>\n\nThe TG-3’s built-in WiFi and the free Olympus Image Share app turn your smart device into a remote extension of your camera. You can operate the zoom, adjust settings and AF points, and trip the shutter. You can geotag photos and share files with the world. And you can apply custom signatures and stamps to your work.\n\n<h4>More Ways To Caputre The Action</h4>\n\nMount the TG-3 on your bike, kayak or surfboard. Set up Interval Shooting – camera start-up time and intervals between shots (both from 1 second to 24 hours). Snap up to 99 frames. Compile the images automatically into a time-lapse movie lasting up to 10 seconds (720p at 10 fps). Enjoy the oohs and aahs of your friends.\n\n<h4>Get back on the beaten path</h4>\n\nIf you venture a little too far off the beaten path, your TG-3 can help. Its next-generation GPS accurately locates your position within 10 seconds. Landmark information can be displayed and recorded with every shot. The built-in e.Compass offers information on direction, latitude and longitude as well as elevation and water depth...in case you push the limits to the extreme. Pair the TG-3 with the OLYMPUS Image Track (OI.Track) smartphone app so you can transfer GPS logs and pictures from your camera to your smartphone\n\n<h4>journey to worlds within</h4>\n\nThe TG-3 offers four macro modes: Microscope, Microscope Control (maximum 44.5x magnification from 1cm), Focus Bracketing and Focus Stacking (multiple images are taken from foreground to background, and the areas in focus are automatically merged into one perfect shot). Add the new LED light guide and you’ve got a complete portable macro set-up.\n\n\n', '\nBUILT FOR THE LONG HAUL <br/>\n\nWaterproofDown to 50 ft / 15 mCrushproofUp to 220 lbf / 100 kgfShockproofUp to 7 ft / 2.1mFreezeproofDown to 14°F / -10°CDustproofYes\nTHE FAST AND THE CURIOUS\n\nLens Aperture RangeWide: f2.0, f2.8, f8.0  Tele: f4.9, f6.3, f18.0Zoom4x Optical Zoom + 2x Super Resolution Zoom + 4x Digital ZoomFocal Length4.5 - 18.0mm (35mm equivalent: 25 - 100mm)Focus Range/Working DistanceWide/Tele: 3.9in/10cm to infinity;  Super Macro Mode: 0.4 in / 1 cm to infinity, focal length 30-100mm(equiv)Image Sensor16 Megapixel – BSI CMOS 1/2.3”Image StabilizationSensor-shift Image ProcessorTruePic VIIiHS (Intelligent High-Speed/High-Sensitivity) EquippedYes\n \nISO SensitivityISO 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400, AUTO, HIGHWhite BalanceAuto, One-touch, Cloudy, Sunny, Incandescent, Fluorescent, UnderwaterShutter Speed1/2 - 1/2000 (Night Scene: Longest 4 sec)Continuous Shooting5fps / 100 images (16M); 15fps / 100 images (3M); 60fps / 100 images (3M)Focus ModeFace Detection AF, AF Tracking, AF LockAF IlluminatorBuilt-in AF IlluminatorFlash ModesAuto, Red Eye Reduction, Fill-in, Off, LED\nCONNECT WITH YOUR SMART DEVICES\n\nWi-Fi ConnectivityThe built-in Wireless LAN and free Olympus Image Share (OI.Share) app enable you to: 1) Easily share files (JPEG/MOV) to iOS and Android mobile devices,  2) Geotag photos with GPS location information from iOS and Android mobile devices, 3) Remotely operate the zoom, activate the self-timer, adjust white balance and exposure (ISO, shutter speed, aperture), select the shooting and drive modes, select the AF area, and trip the shutter, all from an iOS and Android mobile device. 4) Apply custom signatures and Art Filters to photos taken and stamps to Photo Story photos.\n\nGET BACK ON THE BEATEN PATH\n\nGPS & Electronic CompassGPS: Quickly locates position within 10 seconds and is more accurate than ever.

This game-changing technology will forever change what is possible with a DSLR camera.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Shoot Video Like a Camcorder</h4>\r\n<p>The benefits of the groundbreaking Dual Pixel CMOS AF are clearly evident in video shooting, where bringing scenes and subjects into focus is a critical element of the final composition.\r\n   On the EOS 70D, Dual Pixel CMOS AF helps ensure focus is achieved naturally and precisely, even when switching between subjects. And, combined with the predictive power of Movie Servo AF,\r\n   subjects in motion are smoothly and consistently tracked – once the EOS 70D locks focus, it doesn’t let go. Plus, with the shallow depth-of-field afforded by EOS optics, your video gains a\r\n   cinematic ambience.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Compositional Freedom, Quick and Accurate Live View Focus</h4>\r\n<p>\r\n	For stills, Dual Pixel CMOS AF makes Live View AF precise and faster than ever, freeing the photographer to take advantage of the freedom of angle afforded by the camera’s\r\n	Vari-angle LCD monitor. Whether capturing images of athletes on the field or kids in the park – with a tripod or handheld and operated from a number of angles and positions\r\n	– crisp focus can be obtained nearly instantly across a wide shooting area, especially useful for those spontaneous or fleeting shots. And, when composing and\r\n	shooting in Live View mode, the image, exposure and chosen effects can be previewed before shooting, ensuring better accuracy, increased comfort, and more control from the start.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Compatible with over 103 Canon EF Lenses</h4>\r\n<p>\r\n	Over 103 Canon EF lenses are able to fully realize the benefits of Dual Pixel CMOS AF. Compatible lenses greatly expand creative and compositional possibilities so users can\r\n	enjoy a wide range of endeavors made possible through various lenses whether shooting still images or video.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Genius of Pixel Based AF</h4>\r\n<p>\r\n	Dual Pixel CMOS AF is a cutting-edge Canon technology, made possible by a sophisticated redesigning of the CMOS sensor. Traditionally, image sensors have one photodiode per\r\n	pixel, but the CMOS sensor on the EOS 70D has two photodiodes per pixel, enabling each pixel on the sensor to both perform phase-difference detection autofocus and capture\r\n	light – a first for EOS cameras. With phase-difference detection AF, autofocus is achieved quickly and easily on the camera. This unique AF system enables autofocus on 80%\r\n	of the image plane, vertically and horizontally, and helps ensure virtually no loss in image quality\r\n</p>\r\n', '<h4>Specifications</h4>\n\n<strong>Type : </strong>  Digital AF/AE single-lens reflex camera with built-in flash\n\n<strong>Recording Media : </strong> SD card, SDHC card, SDXC memory card <br />\n\n<strong>Image Format : </strong> Approx. 22.5mm x 15.0mm (APS-C) <br />\n\n<strong>Compatible Lenses : </strong> Canon EF lenses (including EF-S lenses) <br />\n\n<strong>Lens Mount : </strong> Canon EF mount <br />\n\n\n<strong>Type : </strong> CMOS Sensor <br />\n\n<strong>Pixels : </strong> Effective pixels: Approx. 20.2 Megapixels - Total pixels: Approx. 20.9 Megapixels <br />\n\n<strong>Pixel Unit : </strong>4.1 µm square <br />\n\n<strong>Total Pixels : </strong>Approx. 19.0 megapixels <br />\n\n<strong>Aspect Ratio : </strong>3:2 (Horizontal: Vertical) <br />\n\n<strong>Color Filter System : </strong>RGB primary color filters <br />\n\n<strong>Low Pass Filter : </strong>Fixed position in front of the image sensor <br />\n\n<strong>Dust Deletion Feature : </strong>(1) Self Cleaning Sensor Unit Removes dust adhering to the low-pass filter.\n<br />\n\n\n<strong>Recording Format : </strong>Complete with Design rule for Camera File System 2.0 and EXIF 2.30 <br />\n\n<strong>Image Format :</strong> Still: JPEG: JPG, RAW: CR2 (Canon Raw 2nd edition), RAW+JPEG Video: MOV (Image data: H.264, Audio: Linear PCM) <br />\n\n<strong>File Size : </strong> 3:2 Aspect Ratio <br />\n\n<strong>Picture Style : </strong> Auto, Standard, Portrait, Landscape, Neutral, Faithful, Monochrome, User Defined 1-3\n<br />\n\n<strong>Settings : </strong> Auto, Preset (Daylight; Shade; Cloudy, Twilight, Sunset; Tungsten light; White Fluorescent Light; Flash), Custom (Approx. 2,000° - 10,000°K), Color Temperature (Approx. 2,500° - 10,000°K)\n<br />\n\n<strong>Auto White Balance</strong> Auto white balance with the image sensor <br />\n\n<strong>Color Temperature Compensation</strong> Blue/amber bias: ±9 levels Magenta/green bias: ±9 levels <br />\n\n\n<strong>Color Temperature Information Transmission</strong> Provided <br />\n\n<strong>Type</strong> Eye-level SLR (with fixed pentaprism) <br />\n\n<strong>Coverage</strong> Approx. 98% vertically and horizontally (with eye point approx. 22mm) <br />\n\n<strong>Magnification</strong> Approx. 0.95x / 27.9° (50mm lens at ∞, -1m-1 dpt) <br />\n\n<strong>Eye Point</strong> Approx. 22mm (At -1m-1 from the eyepiece lens center) <br />\n\n<strong>Dioptric Adjustment Correction</strong> Adjustable from approx. -3.0 to +1.0m-1 (dpt) <br />\n\n<strong>Focusing Screen</strong> Fixed <br />\n\n<strong>Mirror</strong> Quick-return half mirror (transmission: reflection ratio of 40:60) <br />\n\n<strong>AF information</strong> AF points, focus confirmation, AF area selection mode - Exposure information <br />\n\n<strong>Depth Of Field Preview</strong> Enabled with depth-of-field preview button <br />\n'),

A bright, large-aperture zoom lens, a big, extra-sensitive image sensor and other brilliant features are ready to fire up your passion to create. It''s the new RX10 – the compact digital camera that puts boundless picture-taking power in your hands and a fresh new outlook in your sights.\r\n\r\n<h4>More Room to Zoom</h4>\r\n\r\nClose-up shooting is seamless. No switching to macro mode is needed. Zoom in all the way up to extreme telephoto on a subject as near as 30cm away. The built-in lens makes it more convenient for you to take impressive shots throughout a big range.\r\n\r\n<h4>Professional power. Portable size.\r\n</h4>\r\n\r\nAn advanced aspherical lens (AA lens) reduces diameter and length, and maintains high resolution even at image edges. A new Direct Drive SSM (Super Sonic wave Motor) stops lens movement with spot-on precision. Far-reaching optical flexibility minimizes mechanical dimensions. Precise alignment of the image sensor and lens also perfectly combines diminutive form and outsized performance.\r\n\r\n<h4>A Clear Difference</h4>\r\n\r\nBoasting a 20.2MP 1.0-inch Exmor R® CMOS sensor with back-illuminated technology and approximately 4x larger light-sensitive area, RX10 harnesses light and reduces image noise in ways other compact DSC (digital still cameras) can''t match. Combined with the high settings of a wide ISO range, even photos of dimly lit scenes look incredibly clear, crisp, and lifelike.\r\n\r\n<h4>New BIONZ X Image Processing Engine</h4>\r\n\r\nThe groundbreaking new BIONZ® X image processing engine not only maximizes picture quality in ways that only a seamlessly unified body and lens design can realize – it also faithfully reproduces textures and details in real time, as seen by the naked eye, with peerless high-speed processing. The experience of shooting and viewing stills and movies expands your senses by depicting true realism with richer tonal gradations and lower image noise than was previously possible. With such a high magnitude of power ready for every situation, BIONZ X naturally leads toward better ways to capture the world in full glory.\r\n\r\n<h4>Quick Focusing Even at Telephoto Range</h4>\r\n\r\nHigh-speed AF is remarkably smooth thanks to the Direct Drive SSM (Super Sonic wave Motor) with precision-engineered focusing stop positions designed to minimize focusing lens travel distance, which shortens focusing time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', '<h4>Versatile Focus Area Selection\r\n</h4>\r\n\r\nChoose among three concentric Flexible Spot frames for greater focusing versatility and precision than other cameras'' fixed-focus spot frame systems can provide.\r\n\r\n<h4>Lock-on Autofocus with Smart Precision\r\n</h4>\r\n\r\nJust press the shutter button halfway to activate Lock-on AF. It precisely focuses even on moving subjects by continuously adjusting target frame size based on its recognition of subject characteristics. You can easily stay focused on the main action because this object tracking innovation optimizes autofocus timing. Even when a subject goes out of frame temporarily, tracking resumes at the moment that it is recaptured after re-entering the frame.\r\n\r\n<h4>Eye Catching</h4>\r\n\r\nApplying advanced detection technology, this new Eye AF function detects and focuses on a subject''s eye, even if the subject is facing or looking slightly away from the camera. Then, a blinking green frame appears on that eye in the viewfinder image to indicate the point of focus for the upcoming shot.\r\n\r\n<h4>Capture it all in Full HD</h4>\r\n\r\nRecord Full HD movies in the AVCHD Progressive, 1920 x 1080 format and select between supremely smooth-looking 60p or cinematically expressive 24p shooting modes. To maintain clear, steady movie shooting results, optical image stabilization in Active mode effectively reduces camera shake.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Professional-caliber Sound and Recording\r\n</h4>\r\n\r\nThe RX10 has plenty of features to realize more of the potential in your movies. To record sound with precision worthy of professional production, connect a high-performance microphone through an input terminal. Monitor pristine stereo sound through premium-quality Sony headphones plugged into the headphone jack. A built-in HDMI output terminal also accommodates connection of a TV, computer or DVD player/recorder. Audio metering and recording level control are instrumental to keeping soundtracks smooth and consistent. Use the camera''s Multi Interface Shoe and an optional XLR Adaptor Kit to hook up external recording, flash and other accessories. It all adds up to a set of professional-class capabilities that is unprecedented among all other compact cameras.\r\n\r\n<h4>See What You''re Shooting</h4>\r\n\r\nConnect via the HDMI terminal to transfer clear, uncompressed digital movie signal output from the RX10 to an external monitor/recorder simultaneously in real time. Or, for a cleaner view, turn off the shooting info display and watch your movies unfold on an external monitor/recorder.\r\n\r\n<h4>A Truer Viewer</h4>\r\n\r\nSee spectacular clarity, contrast and detail in every scene, regardless of conditions, on the built-in, bright, high-resolution OLED Tru-Finder™. Four dual-sided aspherical lenses provide a big, approximately 33-degree view angle and maintain excellent edge-to-edge visibility of the electronic viewfinder.\r\n\r\n<h4>Customizing Convenient Command</h4>\r\n\r\nFor faster, more intuitive camera operation, you can customize a total of seven buttons by assigning up to 40 types of functions among them. As a result, you will gain more convenient access to your selection of frequently used functions, right at your fingertips.\r\n\r\n<h4>A Spectrum of Settings</h4>\r\n\r\nUse the manual ring to directly control certain settings, zooming and focusing, according to the focus mode in use. In addition, before turning the aperture ring to set F-stop, you can turn Aperture Click Switch on for a stepwise feel of assurance, or off for a quiet, smooth feel when setting the aperture. Display panels on top lets you glance at key settings without moving the camera as you look through the viewfinder.\r\n\r\n<h4>Strong and Light Enough for Anything</h4>\r\n\r\nMagnesium alloy top and front casings make RX10 light, solid and robust enough for long, rigorous use by advanced photographers and videographers. Shoot in rugged outdoor environments without worry as the dust- and moisture-resistant design gives you that added level of confidence to follow your subject wherever they may roam.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Advanced Easy Interface</h4>\r\n\r\nA new, improved graphical user interface makes access to frequently used functions absolutely effortless. Just press the Fn button to display a list of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Cover Every Shooting Angle</h4>\r\n\r\nShoot comfortably from various positions via an approximately 1,229K-dot tiltable 3.0-type White Magic™ LCD screen. The display has the flexibility to be tilted within a range of angles extending from about 84 degrees upward to about 45 degrees downward.\r\n\r\n<h4>Easily Connect with Smartphones and Tablets</h4>\r\n\r\nDownload the free PlayMemories Mobile™ app and instantly connect via Wi-Fi® or NFC (near field communication) by touching a compatible Android™ smartphone or tablet to the camera.

On the flip side though, it uses a much smaller 1/1.7" CCD image sensor with a slightly lower resolution of ten megapixels, almost halves the burst rate to 1.6 frames per second in JPEG mode, requires noise reduction to be applied at ISO 800 or above, doesn''t allow shutter speeds faster than 1/2000 second, and doesn''t offer high-definition movie recording or industry-standard 24 fps framerates. Flash range with this module is 20cm - 4.5m at wide angle, and 15cm - 2.7m at telephoto.\r\n\r\nThe 50mm-equivalent lens module meanwhile uses a much larger APS-C image sensor with slightly higher twelve megapixel resolution, increases the burst rate to three frames per second in JPEG mode, allows shutter speeds as fast as 1/3200 second, allows noise reduction to be disabled at all resolutions, and enables HD movie recording (1,280 x 720 pixels), although the 30 frames per second rate is replaced by 24 fps. To achieve this, it trades away the mechanical image stabilization, has a minimum sensitivity limit of ISO 200, won''t focus closer than seven centimeters, increases body weight by 98 grams and depth by 32.7mm, and drops battery life by almost a quarter to 320 shots. Flash range with this module is 20cm to three meters.\r\n\r\nAs for the magnesium alloy camera body itself, it is dominated on its rear by a 3.0" LCD display with high 920,000 dot resolution, placing it in the region of 640 x 480 pixels, with three dots per color. A built-in flash strobe offers six modes including red-eye reduction, and offers 2.0EV of flash exposure compensation plus manual strength control in twelve steps from full to 1/64th of full power. Images are stored on SD or SDHC cards, or in approximately 86MB of built-in memory. File formats include Adobe''s .DNG Raw and JPEG compressed still images, as well as OpenDML compliant Motion JPEG AVI movies. Connectivity includes NTSC / PAL standard definition and HDMI high-definition video via a Type-C Mini HDMI connector, plus USB 2.0 High-Speed data transfer. Power comes from a 3.6 volt DB-90 Lithium-ion rechargeable battery. Body size without a module attached is 113.9 x 70.2 x 28.9 mm, and weight is 160 grams body-only without a module.\r\n\r\nThe unusual module-based design is intended to offer several main benefits. By combining lens and sensor into one item, Ricoh can ensure the sensor and lens designs are complementary to each others'' requirements. The design also allows size and weight benefits over interchangeable lens cameras with fixed sensors - zoom lens size can be kept down by reducing the size of the image circle to that of a smaller sensor, while a relatvely compact prime lens can use a larger sensor with better light-gathering capability. Finally, with a sealed module, dust can be kept away from the sensor - at least, for lenses with internal focusing and either fixed focal lengths, or an internal zoom design.\r\n\r\nFor lenses with an external focusing or zoom mechanism, the design could have the exact opposite effect however. The action of zooming or (to a lesser extent) focusing such a lens moves air (and with it, dust) into and out of the lens barrel - and once that arrives on the sensor, there''s no way to manually clean it back off inside a sealed module. This is the normal state of play for compact fixed-lens digicams, but offers a potential limitation as compared to Micro Four Thirds and digital SLR cameras where the sensor can be easily cleaned. Bundling lens and sensor together in a single module also means that every lens purchase must also include a sensor - commonly one of the most expensive components in an APS-C camera. It also means both parts must be replaced if one fails outside the warranty period. Likewise, as advancements in rapidly evolving sensor technology appear, they can''t be used with any current lens for the system, and will necessitate new lens purchases when appropriate modules become available. The design also means more complex electronic connections - instead of passing only data to and from the lens to pass power, enable autofocusing, aperture adjustment, correction of lens defects, etc., the design requires that the power, still image / video data, live view stream, flash control, etc. must all be passed between module and body. There''s also an element of potential confusion in the fact that basic camera functionality like still image and movie resolutions, available shutter speeds, etc. changing depending on which module is mounted.\r\n\r\nRicoh is not the first company to experiment with offering interchangeable modules at retail, which couple a lens and sensor into a single package for connection to a camera body. That honor goes to Minolta''s DiMAGE EX1500, offered some eleven years ago - and interestingly, also having debuted with the choice of a 3x zoom module, or a fixed focal length module. In Minolta''s case, the camera wasn''t successful enough to cause the company to offer any further lens / sensor modules, and only two accessory modules were ever offered for the camera - a flash hot shoe module and a MetaFlash module for 3D photography, both of which plugged in between the camera body and lens / sensor module. The DiMAGE EX1500 also offered a capability not found in Ricoh''s camera - the camera body and module could be connected by a short cable, allowing the lens to be pointed in a different direction to that of the attached display.\r\n\r\nWhile US pricing hasn''t been officially announced, the camera and both modules have already appeared in the inventory of reputable US retailers. US street pricing is a rather steep $550 for the camera body without a module. Street pricing for the 50mm-equivalent lens module with APS-C sensor is $830, and the 24 - 72mm equivalent zoom lens module with 1/1.7" sensor is another $440. That brings the total cost for the system without optional external viewfinder to $1,820, leaving Ricoh with something of a challenge, when two cameras offering not dissimilar combined specifications can be purchased together for several hundred dollars less', '<h4>Unique flat sliding lens mount.</h4>\r\n<h4>Interchangeable sealed lens/sensor units.</h4>\r\n<h4>Compact Magnesium Alloy die-cast body with ''GR coating''</h4>\r\n<h4>Extensive customization options and external controls.</h4>\r\n<h4>Extensive customization options and external controls.</h4>\r\n<h4>3.0" 920,000 pixel LCD.</h4>\r\n<h4>Built-in flash and accessory shoe.</h4>\r\n<h4>Optional electronic viewfinder.</h4>\r\n<h4>HDMI connector.</h4>', '<strong>Dimensions Width :</strong>	13.9 <br />\r\n<strong>Depth :</strong>	70.2 <br />\r\n<strong>Weight (body only) :</strong>	198g including battery and memory card <br />\r\n<strong>Optical Zoom :</strong>	10 <br />\r\n<strong>Megapixels :</strong> 10.6 <br />\r\n<strong>Image Sensor :</strong>	1/2.3-inch CMOS <br />\r\n<strong>Optical focal length :</strong> 4.9 to 52.5mm in 35mm film terms <br />\r\n<strong>Viewfinder  :</strong>	EVF optional <br />\r\n<strong>Shutter speed :</strong> 30secs to 1/2000 <br />\r\n<strong>Auto focus :</strong> Nine-point multi, centre spot, snap focus, infinity contrast-detection <br />\r\n<strong>Manual focus :</strong> Yes <br />\r\n<strong>Video (max res/format) :</strong> 1280x730, 30fps <br />\r\n<strong>Max output resolution :</strong>	3648x2736 <br />\r\n<strong>Other resolutions :</strong> 3264x2448, 2592x1944, 2048x1536, 1280x960, 640x480, 648x2048, 3264x1840, 3648x2432, 3264x2176, 2736x2736, 2448x2448\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Exposure control :</strong>	P, A, S, M Scene Mode <br />\r\n<strong>Exposure metering :</strong> Multi, Spot, Centre-weighted <br />\r\n<strong>Exposure compensation :</strong>	+/- 4EV <br />\r\n<strong>ISO settings :</strong> 100-3200 <br />\r\n<strong>LCD Monitor :</strong> 3-inch 920k dots <br />\r\n<strong>Flash range :</strong> Not stated, approx 4m <br />\r\n<strong>Flash modes	:</strong> Auto, Red-eye, Slow sync, Off, Manual <br />\r\n<strong>White balance modes :</strong> 	Auto, multi-point auto, outdoor, cloudy, incandes, 1/2 fluores, manual, detail\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Drive modes :</strong> 	Single, continuous, M-cont, Spd-cont <br />\r\n<strong>Image formats :</strong>	JPEG, Raw, Motion JPEG AVI <br />\r\n<strong>Picture adjustments :</strong> Saturation, sharpness, contrast, colour tone <br />\r\n<strong>Movie length :</strong> Card capacity <br />\r\n<strong>Self timer :</strong> 2/12 custom secs <br />\r\n<strong>Memory card slot :</strong> 	SD/SDHC <br />\r\n<strong>Supplied memory	 :</strong> 86MB <br />\r\n<strong>Batteries supplied :</strong> 1700mAh Li-ion rechargeable <br />\r\n<strong>Charger supplied :</strong> Yes <br />\r\n<strong>A/V output :</strong> PAL, NTSC <br />\r\n<strong>Charging/Computer Connection :</strong>	Yes <br />\r\n<strong>HDMI :</strong>	Yes <br />\r\n<strong>AV Out :</strong> Yes <br />\r\n'),

(14, 19, 'Sumsung NX1', 'Samsung has been pretty inventive in the digital camera world. It was the first to offer an really extensive Wi-Fi system (which continues to this day), Android-based cameras (though Nikon launched a model at about the same time), and arguably the first dedicated ''selfie cams'' with its DualView models.\r\n\r\nThe company has yet again come up with something new, this time in the enthusiast mirrorless space. For the first time ever, Samsung has managed to create an APS-C-sized, 28MP CMOS sensor that''s backside illuminated. BSI sensors move all the circuitry behind the light-capturing part of the sensor which allows it to capture more light, improving low light performance and reducing noise. Until now, the largest sensor with backside illumination was 1"-type (around 1/3rd the size of APS-C).\r\n\r\nThe NX1 sits in a crowded field of excellent cameras - both DSLR and mirrorless - such as the Nikon D7200, Canon EOS 7D Mark II, Panasonic DMC-GH4 and Fujifilm X-T1. Each of these models has its own appeal, whether it be the excellent video specification of the Panasonic, the compactness of the Fujifilm or the all-round capability of the Nikon. While they share similar price tags and build quality and aim for broadly the same audience, the NX1 has quite a few tricks up its sleeve beyond its clever sensor, to try to break into that respectable club.', '<h4>High-speed image processor DRIMe V</h4>\r\nMeet the DRIMe V, Samsung’s fastest, most powerful image processor yet.

Exclusive with the new Leica M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', '<h4>Maximum image quality</h4>\r\n\r\nSuperior sharpness and the finest reproduction of detail. The Leica M features a newly-designed, high resolution, 24-Megapixel CMOS sensor in full 35 mm format – the Leica Max 24-MP sensor. When combined with the Leica Maestro image processor, only outstanding images are created. Additionally, the low noise performance makes the M ideal for available-light photography.\r\n\r\n<h4>Sharp images guaranteed</h4>\r\n\r\nThe classic rangefinder system offers fast, precise, crystal-clear focusing with superior accuracy. Two additional focusing methods allow for even more creativity. The new “Live View Zoom” enables up to 10A-magnification of the Live View display, and the “Live View Focus Peaking” automatically highlights sharp contours in red to provide simple focus control.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Motion pictures with Leica look</h4>\r\n\r\nThe unique quality of Leica lenses has been expanded into the 1080p, full-HD video recording feature of the Leica M. Complete control over exposure and capture settings enables photographers to complement their still images with professional video recordings, with the same look and quality inherent to Leica photography.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Faster results</h4>\r\n\r\nThe combination of the Leica Max 24-MP sensor and Leica’s Maestro processor allows for an extremely high image-processing speed. A low buffer time lets you take photos in rapid succession, not missing a single shot. The processor’s several independent segments permit an incoming image to be processed while a previous one is still being written on the memory card.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Universal capabilities</h4>\r\n\r\nThe new Leica M is the first to feature Live View. Images are composed from material produced by the lens, granting you complete control over depth of field, exposure, framing and focusing. The M’s large, high-resolution 3" monitor with 920,000 pixels allows precise assessment of each potential image with regard to sharpness, exposure and colour.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Use in any weather conditions</h4>\r\n\r\nOur cameras are built to last a lifetime. Solid brass blanks and full-metal bodies from high-strength magnesium alloy and scratch-resistant Corning Gorilla® Glass make bodies and screens resistant to life’s little tumbles. Specially designed rubber seals protect the cameras from splashes, moisture, dust and uncooperative weather\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>For long-endurance missions</h4>\r\n\r\nLeica M’s new lithium-ion battery (1800 mAh) is high performance and rechargeable, ensuring that you are comfortably prepared for long shoots. One single charge guarantees a large number of exposures, which makes the M perfect for shooting in remote locations.\r\n\r\n<h4>Ergonomic handling</h4>\r\n\r\nThe Leica M combines the traditionally valued photographic functions of the M-System with state-of-the-art ergonomic features. With an ergonomically-positioned control wheel on the top plate, intuitive menu navigation and a newly-designed and user-friendly menu interface on the rear monitor, the photographer can concentrate on what’s essential – the images.\r\n\r\n<h4>Compatibility with Leica R-Lenses</h4>\r\n\r\nhe Leica M can take full advantage of almost all lenses in the Leica R-Lenses series, thanks to the new, state-of-the-art Leica R-Adapter. This extensive lens range includes various wide-angle, telephoto and macro lenses as well as a selection of zooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n', '<strong>Model Name: </strong>	Leica M (Typ 240) <br />\r\n	<strong>Manufacturer URL: </strong>	Manufacturer website <br />\r\n	<strong>Model Number: </strong>	M <br />\r\n	<strong>Camera Format: </strong>	Rangefinder\r\n	<strong>Retail Price: </strong>	$6950.00 <br />\r\n	<strong>Street Price: </strong>	$6,495.61 <br />\r\n	<strong>Date Available: </strong>	2012-02-15 <br />\r\n	<strong>Tripod Mount: </strong>	Yes <br />\r\n	<strong>Weight: </strong>	24.0 oz (680 g) <br />\r\n	<strong>includes batteriesSize: </strong>	5.5 x 3.1 x 1.7 in.
